<p>This is a paragraph!</p>

<p>We can break a line in a paragraph with a <br> tag. </p>

<img src="http://dataviscourse.net/tutorials/assets/i/utah.svg" alt="Utah Logo"/>
<p>Include an image. The src attribute defines a link to the image, the alt attribute is used to provide a short description to the image. 
    This is important for screen-reader users, so make sure to put something meaningful there. 
</p>

<p>Headers are defined with h1-h6 tags:</p>
<h1>HTML Tags</h1>
<h2>A second level header</h2>
<p>h1 is the top-level heading, h2 is second-leve, etc.</p>

<!--  HTML also has a comment tag. This is used to add text to your document that will not be displayed in the browser and is useful to document the page, or to temporarily remove something. -->
