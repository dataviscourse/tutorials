<p>This is a paragraph!</p>

<p>We can break a line in a paragraph with a self-closing <br /> br or with a non-closing <br> tag - either is fine. </p>

<img src="http://dataviscourse.net/2017/assets/i/utah.svg" alt="Utah Logo"/>
<p>Include an image. The src attribute defines a link to the image, the alt attribute is used to provide a short description to the image.
Make sure to use the alt attribute as it helps makes your website accessible for screenreaders.</p>

<p>Headers are defined with h1-h6 tags:</p>
<h1>HTML Tags</h1>
<h2>A second level header</h2>
<p>h1 is the most important heading, h2 is less important, etc.</p>

<!--  HTML also has a comment tag. This is used to add text to your document that will not be displayed in the browser and is useful to document the page, or to temporarily remove something. -->
